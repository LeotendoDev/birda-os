# Birda OS - A beginner friendly distrobution

A lightweight and beginner friendly linux distrobution built from scratch.

## Installation Guide
To install the linux distrobution you can simply use the following command:

```console
$ curl -sL https://www.birda.org/download/birda-stable-0.1a.iso
```

Now you have fetched the iso file from the offical birda FTP server.
You can now flash the installed ISO file to a usb flash drive or hard drive. 
If you don't wanna directly flash the OS, you can just try the ISO file in a virtual machine (like VBox, VMware, QEMU)

Once you booted up the os, you'll get a Birda-Installer Shell.
You can now just use the default installation settings, or install the distro manually yourself.
If you diceded to use the default installation, you'll need to execute the following command:

```console
$ birda-install --default
```

After you've done that, you need to reboot your system and then you'll get a login screen.
